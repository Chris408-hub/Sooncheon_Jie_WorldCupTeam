                Germany World Cup squad 2022: Mario Gotze makes surprise return to join final 26-man Germany national
                football team roster in Qatar.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Germany's disappointment at the 2018 FIFA World Cup forced a change within the national team, as manager
                Joachim Low opted to step away from the top job last year.

                Hansi Flick re-injected optimism into his squad ahead of the 2022 edition in Qatar, with Germany's World
                Cup record making them among the favourites.

                With a balanced squad, including an experienced core, and some of Europe's most exciting young players,
                Flick will be confident of repairing the damage of 2018, though late injuries to star players Timo
                Werner and Marco Reus have complicated matters.

            <p class="lb_text">
                Korea World Cup squad 2022: Son Heung-minborn 8 July 1992) is a South Korean professional player who
                plays as a forward for Primier League club Tottenham Hotspur and captains the South Korea national team.
                Considered one of the best forwards in the world and one of the greatest Asian footballers of all time,
                he is known for his explosive speed, finishing, two-footedness and ability to link play
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                A full international since 2010, Son has represented South Korea at the 2014, 1018 and 2022 FIFA World
                Cups and is his country's joint top scorer at World Cups, tied with Park Ji-sung and Ahn Jung-hwan on
                three goals. Son has also represented South Korea at the 2018 Asian Games, where the team won gold, and
                the 2011, 2015, and 2019 editions of the AFC Asian Cup.<br>
                Korea was the runner-up in 2015. Outside of football, Son is viewed as a symbol of national pride in
                South Korea for his achievements, and has been listed in Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 since 2019,
                where he ranked third in 2022.

                given to a South Korea citizen, for his achievements in football.[18] He is credited with causing a
                large uptick in interest in and the number of supporters of Tottenham among South Koreans and even East
                Asians more broadly, resulting in the club's social media strategy altering in order to target and cater
                to Koreans using both the club's standard English language accounts and their newer accounts in Korean.

                The Korean national soccer team, led by coach Paulo Bento, is ranked 28th in the FIFA rankings. 4th in the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan (3 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses), 17th in the 2006 World Cup in Germany (1 win, 1 draw and 1 loss), and 2010 World Cup in South Africa 15th place (1 win, 1 draw, 2 losses), 27th place at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil (0 wins, 1 draw, 2 losses), and 9th place at the 2018 World Cup in Russia (1 win, 0 draws, 2 losses).
