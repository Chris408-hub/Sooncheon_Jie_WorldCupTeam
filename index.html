                Germany World Cup squad 2022: Mario Gotze makes surprise return to join final 26-man Germany national

                Germany's disappointment at the 2018 FIFA World Cup forced a change within the national team, as manager
                Joachim Low opted to step away from the top job last year.

                Hansi Flick re-injected optimism into his squad ahead of the 2022 edition in Qatar, with Germany's World
                Cup record making them among the favourites.

                With a balanced squad, including an experienced core, and some of Europe's most exciting young players,
                Flick will be confident of repairing the damage of 2018, though late injuries to star players Timo
                Werner and Marco Reus have complicated matters.

                Despite dropping out at the group stages in Russia four years ago, Germany have been one of the most
                consistent national
                sides in World Cup history, with a triumph in 2014, alongside two semifinals, and a runner-up spot,
                since 2002.
